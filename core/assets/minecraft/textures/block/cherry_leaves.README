Right now I think that their leaves are actually just about right.
When I make them regular, they look like checkerboards, unnatural.
This may be because the blossoms are functinoally chaotic, like
flames are, and should be left that way. I may revisit this, so I'm
saving the PSD file, but I'm not generating the PNG file from them.

The same goes for pink_petals, mine were _worse_.
