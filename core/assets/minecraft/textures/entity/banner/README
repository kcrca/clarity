Originally, these images used black for transparency -- if a pixel was supposed to be 80% transparent,
it would be 80% gray (dark gray).

When they changed these to use transparency for transparency, I took the opportunity to rework some
of the banners. These banners have psd files without a black background (at least not visible)>

For the rest, I left the psd files (if any) alone, and wrote a program transparify.py that converted
each pixel according to its darkness to pure-white transparency at the same level.
