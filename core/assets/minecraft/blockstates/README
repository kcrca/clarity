Override normal blockstates to force the textures to all align no
matter the block orienation, which is needed for the pattern to
look uniform in a sea of sand in all texture packs, and for the
connected texture pack look (the ctm stuff doesn't take block
orientation into account, so they all have to be the same for it
to work).
