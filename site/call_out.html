        <p>
            The Call Out texture pack is designed to help you find things you haven't yet textures in your own texture
            pack.
            You use it by putting it in the resource pack list between your pack and the default. This
            is show in the example below, using my custom pack named <a href="/">"Clarity"</a>:

        <figure class="example">
            <figcaption>How to order Call Out with your pack (in this example, named "Clarity")</figcaption>
            <center>
                <img src="call_out_order.png">
            </center>
        </figure>

        <p>
            When you do this, if you're missing a block in your pack, that block will be shown highlighted in bright
            green. Here, I've forgotten to create a texture for gravel:

        <figure class="example">
            <figcaption>Gravel is not in the resource pack!</figcaption>
            <center>
                <img src="no_gravel.png">
            </center>
        </figure>

        <p>
            As you can see, if you look at a bunch of blocks, the undone ones will be called out by their green color.
            (You may have similar colors in your texture, but unless they are common, you can still use this pack.)

        <p>
            Because most packs aren't re-texturing the GUI, the sun and moon, or the font, these aren't colored. But if
            you want them, you can use the second pack, named "Call Out All". Which &mdash; when combined with Call Out
            &mdash; will call out everything except the font. (The font being green would just make the GUI too hard to
            read.)

        <p> I hope this helps you be as complete as you want to be! Here they are:
