  <h1 class="">Clarity</h1>
  <p>
  Clarity gives you minecraft in a clear, no-nonsense way. Very low noise, very high visibility.
  <p>
  The design guidelines are:
  <ul>
      <li>What is different looks different, what is related looks related.
      <li>Cleanliness balanced with elegance.
      <li>Low noise.
      <li>Color fidelity with vanilla: If blocks are used to create a certain feel in vanilla, the feel should be similar in Clarity.
      <li>Recognizability: You should be able to naturally know what's what.
  </ul>
