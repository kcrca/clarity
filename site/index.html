            Clarity gives you minecraft in a clear, no-nonsense way. Very low noise, very high visibility.

        <p>
            Playing with Clarity is a much calmer experience than vanilla, or even many simplified packs. When there is
            less noise, there are fewer things calling for your attention. When differences are clear, information you
            need is easily in your grasp. The visual world demands less of you, and you play with less distraction and
            more confidence.

        <table role="presentation">
            <tr>
                <td>
                    The design guidelines are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cleanliness balanced with elegance.
                        <li>Low noise.
                        <li>Fidelity with vanilla: If you use blocks to create a certain feel in vanilla, the feel
                            should be similar in Clarity.
                        <li>Recognizability: You should be able to naturally know what's what.
                        <li>What is different looks different, what is related looks related.
                    </ul>

            The pack is quite complete, all blocks, mobs, items, GUI, paintings, effects... Almost all are 16x16, but a
            few are larger where it reduced noise a lot (for example, curved rail). Some particles (such as lava sparks)
            are left untouched on purpose.

            There are several things which the default textures hide, and Clarity makes clear:
        <ul>
            <li>There are actually two stages of sapling, eight stages of carrots and potatoes, four stages of nether
                wart, and five stages of growing chorus flower.
            <li>Similarly, some grow until they get too old. But is a plant too old? Clarity shows you.
            <li>How wet is the farmland? There are eight levels.
            <li>How much power the light and heavy pressure plates are generating is shown.
            <li>Similarly, how much power the daylight detectors are generating is shown by lighting up cells.
            <li>The compass changes depending on where you are pointed. (It can be inaccurate, but at least Clarity
                tries to show you.)
        </ul>
        <figure class="example">
            <figcaption>Each plant stage has different images. Here are four of the eight stages of potatoes and

            If you want to know more about the Clarity pack family and its design, you have come to the right place. (I
            don't know what's wrong with you, but this <em>is</em> the right place.)

            <li> Version numbering will be the same as the Minecraft version they are built for (for example, version
                1.16.2 is made for Minecraft 1.16.2). Intermediate releases for the same Minecraft version will have
                another subversion place added (1.16.2.1).
            <li> All mobs are modified, but for many of them, the primary goal is simply noise reduction. Chickens,
                polar bears, endermen, etc., are often only changed to simpler swaths of color.
            <li> Fires are lowered in height, so they don't interfere with your vision, and are slowed down to be less
                frantic, but are otherwise untouched. They are by nature rather noisy so it made sense to leave them as
                such.
            <li> Rain and snow are vanilla textures with reduced numbers of drops/flakes. This makes them a lot less
                annoying, but still visible.
            <li><b>Continuity</b> and <b>Connectivity</b> don't make everything continuous/connected. Things that are
                independent at the block level, such as furnaces and pistons, are still edged.
            <li> I may find a good hi-res font to integrate. For now, pick your favorite!
            <li> Some plants stop growing if their tops are too old (sugar cane, kelp, and cactus). Each has a lot of
                intermediate ages (for kelp it's 25), but I texture only the oldest, so you can see that no more growth
                is possible.
            <li><b>Currents</b> only shows values for redstone wire. I'd like to include daylight detectors, targets,
                and so on, but it is not possible to add transparent textures to most blocks, so there is no way to do
                this in a visually tolerable way.

            The way to get art that isn't pixelated is to find original artwork that is entirely rectilinear (in other
            words,
            pre-pixelated). Luckily there are abstract painters who worked in this style.

            Of course, at 16x16 pixels (and multiples thereof), portraying these works requires approximations,
            especially to avoid aliasing issues. You should see the originals or good photographs to get a better
            experience.

        <p> The unused elemental paintings "Earth", "Wind", "Fire", and "Water" were done by me because I thought
            they were interesting problems.

            If you're trying to do a complete pack, my <a href="https://claritypack.com/call_out.html">
            Call Out</a> pack can help you find things you've missed.

        <p>
            In doing this pack, I was originally inspired by the <a
                href="http://www.planetminecraft.com/texture_pack/ocd-pack/">oCd pack</a> by FVDisco. I liked it at
            first, but eventually its rigid blockiness turned me off. I started by modifying how far down the side of
            the block grass spilled, and eventually replaced everything. But I would not have started if oCd wasn't
            almost <i>but not quite</i> the way I liked it, and my choices were influenced by it.

        <p>
            I also took some inspiration from the <a href="http://www.planetminecraft.com/texture_pack/paper-cut-out">Paper
            Cut Out</a> resource pack by SuperAlgae. Which I really like.

        <p>
            The <a href="https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/resource-packs/">Vanilla Tweaks</a> site has a lot of
            interesting ideas, a few of which inspired work. And their downloading model is interesting.

        <p>
            Most of my testing has been done in <a href="restworld/">RestWorld</a>, a resourcepack testing
            world I created that is compact and pretty complete. <a href="restworld/">Check it out!</a>

        <p>
            Clarity also textures my filter mod <a href="philter">"philter"</a>, so maybe you want try that out.
