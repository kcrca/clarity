            Clarity gives you minecraft in a clear, no-nonsense way. Very low noise, very high visibility.

                    The design guidelines are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>What is different looks different, what is related looks related.
                        <li>Cleanliness balanced with elegance.
                        <li>Low noise.
                        <li>Fidelity with vanilla: If you use blocks to create a certain feel in vanilla, the feel
                            should be similar in Clarity.
                        <li>Recognizability: You should be able to naturally know what's what.
                    </ul>

        </table>

        <p>
            Playing with Clarity is a much calmer experience than vanilla, or even many simplified packs.
            When there is less noise, there are fewer things calling for your attention.
            When differences are clear, information you need is easily in your grasp.
            The visual world demands less of you, and you play with less distraction and more confidence.

        <p>
            The pack is nearly complete, with all blocks, all mobs, most items, all UI, and all paintings. Almost all
            are 16x16, but a few are larger where it reduced noise a lot (for example, curved rail).

            <figure class="example">
                <figcaption>Example: Harvest-ready crops stand out clearly from the rest, and each crop can be told from
                    the other:

        Clarity is actually a small family of packs:

            <tr>
                <td><img src="clarity_thumb.png" border=1/></td>
                <td><b>Clarity</b> has edges around most blocks to make it easy to count them, and see where blocks
                    begin and end.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><img src="continuity_thumb.png" border=1/></td>
                <td><b>Continuity</b> has almost no edges, giving a continuous experience of the world.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><img src="connectivity_thumb.png" border=1/></td>
                <td><b>Connectivity</b> adds connected textures that work with both Clarity and Continuity.</td>

                <td><img src="beguile_thumb.png" border=1/></td>
                <td><b>Beguile</b> is just the UI elements, so you can have the clean UI with any pack you like!</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>
            Both Clarity and Continuity have a rich connected texture pack with dozens of blocks.

        <p>
            If you want to know more about Clarity and its design, you have come to the right place. (I don't know
            what's wrong with you, but this <em>is</em> the right place.)

        <ul>
            <li> Versions will be the same as the Minecraft version they are built for (e.g., version 1.10 is ready
                for Minecraft 1.10). If I need some way to distinguish between multiple versions of Clarity for the same
                version of Minecraft, I'll come up with something.
            <li> All mobs are modified, but for many of them, the primary goal is simply noise reduction. Chickens,
                polar bears, endermen, etc., are primarily changed to simpler swaths of color.
            <li> Fire, water, lava, and most particles are untouched on purpose. There was little change that improved
                them, and they are by nature rather noisy so it made sense to leave them as such. Animated connected
                textures to match animated bordered ones.
            <li> Rain and snow are vanilla textures with reduced numbers of drops/flakes. This makes them a lot less
                annoying, but still quite visible.
            <li> Continuity doesn't make everything continuous. Things that are independent at the block level, such as
                furnaces and pistons, are still edged.
            <li> Items are about ⅔ done. As with mobs, many look good just with noise reduced. Others, such as the
                tools, redstone dust, and sugar are less noisy if you put in art that is rotated 45º when displayed,
                making lines that are pixelated at 45º actually straight. I still expect to do more items, when I can
                figure out ways to reduce their noise without increasing the resolution. Or maybe I will just give in to
                more higher-resolution items. And I may find a good hi-res font to integrate. For now, pick your
                favorite!
        </ul>

            <h1>Paintings</h1>
        </div>
        <p>
	The way to get art that wasn't pixelated was to find artwork that was entirely rectilinear.
	Luckily there are abstract painters who worked in this style.

	<ul class="paintings">

	Of course, at 16x16 pixels (and multiples thereof), portraying these works requires
	approximations, especially to avoid aliasing issues. You should see the originals or
	good photographs to get a better experience.

        <p>
            In doing this pack, I was originally inspired by the <a
                href="http://www.planetminecraft.com/texture_pack/ocd-pack/">oCd pack</a> by FVDisco. I liked it at
            first, but eventually its rigid blockiness
            turned me off. I started by modifying how far down the side of the block grass spilled, and eventually
            replaced most everything. But I would not have started if oCd wasn't almost <i>but not quite</i> the way I
            liked it, and my choices were influenced by it.

        <p>
            I also took some inspiration from the <a href="www.planetminecraft.com/texture_pack/paper-cut-out">Paper
            Cut Out</a> resource pack by SuperAlgae. Which I really like.
        <p>
            I did a lot of my testing in <a
                href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/resource-packs/1243823-qmagnets-test-map-for-resource-packs-and-map">QMAGNET's
