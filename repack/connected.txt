ctm needs to know the top of the repacked (finished) continuity, as a source of edgeless images.

The list of ctm'ed blocks should be the same (unless overridden somehow?) as continuity,
so it needs continuity's repack.cfg

Each ctm change needs
    png file name (from which to get edged and edgeless images, and resolution)
    edge width (default 1)
    ctm template name
    blockID/damages

So

[ctm]
<ctm_template_name>: <name[:width]>
means to use templates/ctm_template_name.width'x'resolution

Each template has a block.properties file which will be filled in
The directory also has a set of masks
