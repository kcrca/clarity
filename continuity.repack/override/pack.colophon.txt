Font: Superclarendon Bold 83 (Might be Black instead of Bold)

The font of Robert Indiana's original is debated, many consider Clarendon Black the closest match,
but it isn't the same font. I didn't feel it worth it to play that hard to get it exactly right
when this is a logo that nobody but me ever sees.
