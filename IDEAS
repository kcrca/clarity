The blockstate of a hopper allows you to see if it is enabled or not. I could
texture the hopper to look differently. Although minecraft doesn't seem to
update the model to use properly when this state changes, so for now, not doing
this.  (Bug: https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-209658?filter=-2)

Use squared-off pointed dripstone [CM]

Put "can sleep" icon in clock? [RS]

On noteblock, show instrument, possibly via copying color from exemplar block. [RS]

Put power numeric above things: pressure plates, sculker box, daylight
detectors, cake. Make sure target is consistent (or compatible anyway). [RS]

Put red tip on lever when powered. [RS]

* Make subtraction mode on comparators more different. [RS]

* Show powered fence gate/door/trap door (vs. one that's just open). [RS]

* Lectern when powered [RS]

Show cauldron, composter fill level/contents on sides and top. [RS]
