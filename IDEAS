The blockstate of a hopper allows you to see if it is enabled or not. I could
texture the hopper to look differently. Although minecraft doesn't seem to
update the model to use properly when this state changes, so for now, not doing
this.  (Bug: https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-209658?filter=-2)

Use squared-off pointed dripstone [CM]

On noteblock, show instrument, possibly via copying color from exemplar block. [RS]

Put power numeric above things: pressure plates, sculker box, daylight
detectors, cake. Make sure target is consistent (or compatible anyway). [RS]

Cauldrons:
    Show cauldron, composter fill level/contents on sides and top. [RS]
    show cauldron contents on side somewhere (make the strip be the contents?)
    cauldron held in hand sucks from FP view

CM: Canis minor (find URL)

villages have longer aprons (two more pixels), use them?
    also illagers

bundles can be different based on fullness, do that?
